# Appendix D: Accessing BeagleBone as a network drive

Once a BeagleBone is connected to your computer, you can access it as a shared network drive either in Windows Explorer or the Mac equivalent. Through this method you can copy detection data as well as modify configuration files. It may also be possible to access data files on a BB even if you cannot access the Web Interface or create an FTP connection. Itâ€™s a useful backup method, but it usually involves some initial configuration.
