# What to bring

Before you go into the field to check a station, it's important to have a few key items on hand. Some of these are absolutely essential while others can save you future time and headaches if you have them with you at a site and can resolve issues while there.

The following list is broken down by receiver type. Essential, or very important, items are indicated with **solid circles** while optional \(but often useful\) items are represented by **hollow circles**.

Note: this covers the items needed to connect to an SG, download data and modify configuration files, and perform basic troubleshooting, whether at your desk or in the field; it does not include items needed for a general station chek
