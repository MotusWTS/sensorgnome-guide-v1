# Appendix: Installing BeagleBone drivers

On newer computers, such as with Windows 10, the operating system blocks the installation of the BeagleBone drivers as they are “unsigned,” and there may be no informative error message as a result.

The way around this is to temporarily disable this security check. Instructions on how to do that [can be found here](https://www.howtogeek.com/167723/how-to-disable-driver-signature-verification-on-64-bit-windows-8.1-so-that-you-can-install-unsigned-drivers/). Option 2 is the simplest and the security measures will revert after the next reboot.
